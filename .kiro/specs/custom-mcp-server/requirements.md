# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) server using the Python SDK that connects to a local NoSQL database and provides CRUD operations through MCP client commands. The system will include a pre-populated database with sample data, a fully functional MCP server, and a demonstration client to showcase the capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a custom MCP server with database connectivity, so that I can provide structured data access through the MCP protocol.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server is started THEN it SHALL successfully connect to a local NoSQL database
2. WHEN the database connection is established THEN the server SHALL be ready to accept MCP client requests
3. IF the database is unavailable THEN the server SHALL handle the error gracefully and provide meaningful error messages
4. WHEN the server receives an MCP request THEN it SHALL process the request and return structured JSON responses

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to perform CRUD operations through MCP commands, so that I can manage data in the NoSQL database remotely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a CREATE command is received THEN the server SHALL insert a new record into the specified collection
2. WHEN a READ command is received THEN the server SHALL fetch and return the requested records
3. WHEN an UPDATE command is received THEN the server SHALL modify existing records based on provided criteria
4. WHEN a DELETE command is received THEN the server SHALL remove records matching the specified criteria
5. WHEN any CRUD operation fails THEN the server SHALL return appropriate error messages with details

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to perform search and filter queries, so that I can retrieve specific subsets of data based on criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a search query is received THEN the server SHALL filter records based on the provided criteria
2. WHEN filtering by user assignment THEN the server SHALL return all tasks assigned to the specified user
3. WHEN multiple filter criteria are provided THEN the server SHALL apply all criteria using logical AND operations
4. WHEN no records match the criteria THEN the server SHALL return an empty result set with appropriate status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a pre-populated database with sample data, so that I can immediately test and demonstrate the MCP server functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is initialized THEN it SHALL contain sample collections for users, tasks, and products
2. WHEN the users collection is queried THEN it SHALL return at least 3 sample user records with realistic data
3. WHEN the tasks collection is queried THEN it SHALL return at least 5 sample task records with user assignments
4. WHEN the products collection is queried THEN it SHALL return at least 4 sample product records with pricing information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a sample MCP client script, so that I can demonstrate and test all server capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the client script is executed THEN it SHALL successfully connect to the MCP server
2. WHEN the client demonstrates INSERT operations THEN it SHALL add new records to each collection
3. WHEN the client demonstrates FETCH operations THEN it SHALL retrieve and display all records from each collection
4. WHEN the client demonstrates UPDATE operations THEN it SHALL modify existing records and confirm changes
5. WHEN the client demonstrates DELETE operations THEN it SHALL remove records and verify deletion

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive setup instructions, so that I can easily run the MCP server and client locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN following the setup instructions THEN the database SHALL be installed and configured correctly
2. WHEN following the setup instructions THEN all Python dependencies SHALL be installed successfully
3. WHEN following the setup instructions THEN the MCP server SHALL start without errors
4. WHEN following the setup instructions THEN the sample client SHALL execute all demonstrations successfully
5. WHEN the setup is complete THEN the system SHALL be ready for extension and customization
